## Overview

Welcome to my home Kubernetes cluster.

Lots of fun (to me at least ;)) stuff can be found, poke around my [deployments](./deployments/) directory to see what my cluster is running. Feel free to open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/bjw-s/k8s-gitops/issues/new) or join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/DNCynrJ) if you have any questions.
